## Data Overview  
The data folder contains all of the necessary data (or provides directories to
pipe data into from the scripts folder) for building SDMs.  

1. .csv files are either occurence data or data related to initial exploration 
of appropriate candidate species. The main file here is candidate occurences, 
which is the main occurence data used to split into different species in the 
split_data directory.  

2. .rds files are compressed files related to environmental rasters or mapping. 
bioclim_full.rds, bv_t2 and bv_t1 are the most important pieces here as they 
are the gridded bioclim rasters for each time period (or the full summary with 
bioclim_full.rds).
