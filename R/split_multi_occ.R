#' split_multi_occ 
#' Splits a multi-species dataframe of occurence data into dataframes for each 
#' species into a new directory. Multi-species dfs are typically generated by 
#' scripts from the pulling_organizing_data folder, but we need separate 
#' dataframes to run multiple species in parallel
#'
#' @param multi_species_df the multi-species dataframe to be split
#'
#' @return nothing, but writes the individual dataframes as .rds files to a new 
#' directory at the top level of organization of the project called split_data
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
